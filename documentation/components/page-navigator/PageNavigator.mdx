# PageNavigator

`PageNavigator` is a component used to display and switch between multiple "pages" in a horizontal navigation bar. It supports icons, keyboard navigation, overflow handling, dynamic page addition, and accessibility best practices.

---

## Features

- Keyboard arrow navigation
- Overflow scroll with fade edges
- Dynamic page insertion (`+` button between pages)
- Dropdown actions per page
- Accessibility with `aria-current`, tooltips, and focus management
- Handles long page titles gracefully

---

## Props

<ArgTypes of={PageNavigator} />

---

## Usage Example

Use the `PageNavigator` to help users switch between logical steps or sections within a UI. Each page accepts a `title`, an `icon`, and an `id`.

---

## Stories

### Default

<Canvas of={Default} />

---

### With Many Pages

<Canvas of={WithManyPages} />

---

### With Long Titles

<Canvas of={WithLongTitles} />

---

### More Complex (with dynamic ID generation)

<Canvas of={MoreComplex} />

---

### No Pages

<Canvas of={NoPages} />

---

## Best Practices

- Use concise titles to avoid truncation.
- Pair icons with labels for better scannability.
- Use the `onAddNewPage` callback to dynamically inject new items in the correct position.
- Use tooltips or `aria-label` for hidden or truncated content.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tip

You can simulate adding pages by clicking on the inline `+` buttons between steps in the stories. Try out different configurations to see how `PageNavigator` adapts.
